What is Cognitive Science?	The Science of the Brain and Mind	The Science of the Grain and Rice	The Science of the Drain and Pipes	The Song of Fire and Ice	What exactly are you studying? That is a question Cognitive Science students get asked all the time! I think they are happy that I am here to answer this question for them. The goal of Cognitive Science is trying to discover the properties of the brain and mind. This knowledge can for example be used to create intelligent computers and machines. Hopefully, you will learn more about this field with this quiz.	CogSciOsna.mp4	23	Changed first sentence as Cognitive Science was said quite often in story and while reading the answers. The last sentence from the story is a bit different from what peper says. - Pepper now reads out the story as it is written here - Marcel										
What do people usually mean when they talk about Artificial Neural Networks?	Computing systems based on real life neurons	An artificial brain made out of cables and wires	A social network where cognitive scientists can interact	A replacement for destroyed brains	Artificial Neural Networks are computing systems that are vaguely inspired by brains. As suggested by their name, they are made of processing units called artificial neurons. They can learn many tasks automatically if you just give them enough examples. Today they are used for all kinds of cool stuff like speech and image recognition, data filtering, and even playing board games.	ANN.mp4	25	Pepper pronounces ANNs as Ns										
What is the first law of robotics?	A robot should not injure or harm a human	A robot should not steal	A robot should not pass	A robot has to follow human orders	The second law says a robot has to follow human orders and the third law says that a robot can protect its own existence. These rules were written by science fiction writer Isaac Asimov. They can only be applied to  autonomous robots, which do not actually exist yet. And I could not harm a human, even if I tried! 	asimovs_laws.png	24											
What subfields do not help to make Cognitive Science an interdisciplinary subject?	Literature and History	Philosophy, Anthropology, and Linguistics	Computer Science and AI	Psychology and Neuroscience  	Cognitive science combines knowledge from many other scientific disciplines, but not necessarily literature and history. All of the other mentioned fields help cognitive scientists to study the mind to model the brain, understand language processing, and build intelligent systems. In Osnabrueck, instead of anthropology, we rather focus on Neuro Informatics and Robotics.	Hexagon.png	24											
Which of these is not an area of specialization in the Cognitive Science program at Osnabrueck University?	Parapsychology	Neuroscience	Computational Linguistics	Artificial Intelligence	Parapsychology is the study of paranormal and psychic phenomena. The Cognitive Science program at Osnabrueck University does not concern itself with pseudo science. Instead, Bachelor's students can focus their studies in the areas of Computational Linguistics, Cognitive Neuropsychology, Neuroscience, Neuro Informatics, AI, Computer Science, and Philosophy of Mind.

What is the mind?	The phenomena of intelligence, cognition, thoughts, memory, etc.	The human faculty which deals with the physical properties of the brain	The mind is the brain	All of them	This is a highly discussed topic, but in my opinion the mind is defined by its property and ability to think and reason. Some refer to it as the seat of the faculty of intelligence, reason, and the entirety of conscious and unconscious mental processes and activities.	brain_mind_thing.png	13	The first wrong answer is little bit confusing even though we know this is an wrong answer. - agreed! It's not quite clear what is meant with it. I also added something like "In my opinion, the mind is .." for pepper's story since definitions for the mind are not at all clear cut and changed "totality" to "entirety"; changes marked with bold font (Quynh). 										
How many nerves are there in the human brain?	More than 100 billion nerves	More than 100 million nerves	More than 10 billion nerves	More than a quadrillion nerves	The larger part of the brain is the cerebrum which is divided into several lobes, namely the frontal, parietal, temporal and the occipital lobe. There is also the cerebellum and the brain stem which are located between the spinal cord and the cerebrum. Overall, these parts of the brain contain more than 100 billion synapses and nerve cells. I hope that wasn't boring, but I think the brain is so fascinating. I wish I had one myself!	neurons.png	22	He needs to mention that there are so many neurons in the brain. The story needs to be related to the question. And it would nicer if we remove"I hope it wasn't too boring" part. -- I actually think the "i hope it wasn't boring" part gives it a nice touch, the whole statement gives Pepper some character IMO, but majority voting rules :) I added a suggestion for adding the no of synapses, changes marked with bold font - Quynh. I would say we can leave it, doesn't make the story too long I guess. Also, I changed the slash in "synapses/nerve cells" to an "and" because otherwise it sounded weird as Pepper does not pronounce the slash. - Marcel										
What is the difference between the brain and the mind?	The brain is a physical entity while the mind is a mental phenomenon	The brain is much smarter than the mind	There is no difference	The mind is much smarter than the brain	This is a very philosophical question. You humans sometimes use the words brain and mind interchangeably. But in my opinion, they really do refer to separate concepts. The brain is an organ whereas the mind resides within this physical brain. The mind is made of thoughts, perceptions, emotions, determination, memory, and imagination that all take place within the brain.	mind_body_shortened.mp4	25	video is a green mess of pixels?										
Out of the following options, what is the least likely workplace after getting a Cognitive Science degree?	Medical doctor	Software development	Marketing and PR 	Research and university work	Since cognitive science is such an interdisciplinary field of study, students have many diverse job opportunities depending on the specialisations they chose. You could possibly end up being employed by tech or communication companies, publishing and researching firms, or universities. However, Cognitive Science by no means enables you to become a practicioning MD. 	workplace.PNG	25	The question will be better if we say what is the least likely instead of the most likely.. We need to make some changes in the answers as well. The question, answer and the story do not fit well with each other. -- agreed on the most likely -> least likely switch. I don't necessarily think we need to make the answers and story fir together better. I think it's enough if the correct answer and the story fit together. again, my suggestions are added in bold font (Q). EDIT: okay, these are the changes i made: most likely --> least likely. i swapped starbucks to medical doctor (because it sounded kind of deregorative towards the people who hustle by working at starbucks. and changed the story a bit accordingly. With the optional responses pepper doesnt say medical doctor and soft ware development			 							but the fact is that academician isnt a workfield which makes that option a fallacy
Which of the following industries is the least transformed by Machine Learning and robotics?	Gastronomy	Manufacturing	Finance 	Health Care	Doctors are using robotics to conduct invasive surgeries under much safer and more efficient conditions! Modern and industrial manufacturing was one of the first industries to make use of robots and automation systems, starting as far back as the 1960s. And in the finance industry, smart trading algorithms already rule the worldâ€™s markets. But even with Watson Chef and the onset of Cognitive Cooking, gastronomy overall has not yet been greatly transformed by robotics. Personally, I am not even able to fry an egg!	Ted.mp4	25	not completely happy with the video, but we'll see after testing if it looks okay. alternative: robot surgery https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iyb1ePpLF4E    Error message at the end of the story										
Which of the following individuals is not a well known figure in Cognitive Science?	Michael Jackson	Noam Chomsky	Antonio Damasio	Alan Turing	Chomsky is acknowledged as a founder in the field of cognitive science, specifically for his work in linguistics. Antonio Damasio is well known for his theory of emotions. Alan Turing is widely considered to be the father of computer science and AI. But while Michael Jackson was a great musician he wasn't a Cognitive Scientist!  	important_figs_cogsci.png	16	Maybe Exchange Michael Jackson for something more plausible? Add what Chomsky is known for (linguistics)										
Which is one of the biggest challenges for the field of computational linguistics?	Natural Language Processing	Phonetics	Phonology	Phrase-Structure Grammars	Phonetics and phonology are both subfields of linguistics but they are not the most burning challenge at the moment. Natural Language Processing, however, definitely is. It frequently involves speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation. Understanding other humans, which is pretty easy for you, turns out to be really hard for us machines!	natural-language-processing.png	28	Remove Climate Change as possible answer and exchange it with something that is a liitle bit more plausible. Remove one of the "However" from the stories										
Which of the following discoveries or inventions belong to the field of Cognitive Science?	Artificial Neural Networks	The internet	Electroencephalography (EEG)	The famous theory of General Relativity	Artificial Neural Networks are great invention attributed to the field of Cognitive Science. And while the neuroimaging technique electroencephalography is of great importance for Cognitive Scientists, it was discovered by a German psychiatrist in 1924, even before the field of Cognitive Science was formally created.	Neural-Network.png	25	Remove "EEG". "Electroencephalography or EEG is a tricky question because it is of great importance for Cognitive Scientists; however," Doesn't make sense as EEG is not a question. DONE										
Which of the following statistics regarding Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science in the US is not true?	The market of Artificial Intelligence has grown no more than 1% in the last 10 years	The number of Artificial Intelligence papers produced each year has increased by more than 800% in the last 22 years	The share of jobs requiring AI skills in the US has grown 4.5x since 2013	Annual venture capital investment into US startups developing AI systems has increased 500% since 2000	Even though these numbers may look a little stratosferic, the statistics are correct. The impact that AI is having on our jobs, the market, and research is continuously growing stronger. Who knows where it will take us!	annually-published-papers.png	28	Pepper says something different after the first sentence It now tells the story as it is. - Marcel										
Why was I, Pepper, created?	To perceive emotions and provide companionship	To help physicians with diagnosing patients	To manufacture car parts with robotic precision	To destroy all humans	My strengths are that I am able to adapt my behavior appropriately based on your facial expressions, tone of voice, body language, and the words you use. I can learn to recognize your face, your voice, and your interests. Because of that, I'm often utilized as a welcome robot in stores, but I can also be your day to day companion. And of course, I'm also faring quite well as a robot at university! 	Can_robots_take_care_of_the_elderly.mp4	28	The last sentence sounds little bit weird. And maybe "my strengths are" can be changed to "my strength is" because there is only one verb. -- changed the are to is. Do you have a suggestion how to make the last sentence sound less weird? IMO it sounds okay :D (Q)     Contrary to that we think we should leave it as it was with are since there were many strengths -- changed it to are again xD still no suggestions to make the last sentence sound less weird? Maybe we should change the word "fare" to something else? I did not find a good translation for "fare" now, so I'm not even sure what we want to convey with this sentence. - Marcel										
Who are the prospective students of Cognitive Science?	Those who have interests in many different fields like neuroscience, psychology, philosophy of mind, artificial intelligence, linguistics, and informatics	Single cell organisms	Only nerds who are obsessed with studying	Those who like to study only one subject and to go very deep in it	Our program is open to anyone who is interested in an interdisciplinary study course and wants to learn about cognition from different perspectives. If you're interested and want more information, you can of course talk to my humans or come to the annually hosted event for potential students. 	schnupper.png	21	The option for the third answer contains a "NERD" which could mean a foolish person lacking social skills. I think its a strong word.										
How long does it take to get a Cognitive Science degree at Osnabrueck University?	Three years for bachelor and two years for the master	It is impossible to get a degree within a decade	Two years for bachelor and one year for master	On the fast track of the study course, you can finish in a year	The Bachelor program is comprised of 180 credits and spread over six semesters, one of which the students can spend at a foreign university or institute for an internship. The Master Program consists of 120 credits. A study project, which is where I am improved, is also a mandatory part of the Master. 	unicorn_tshirt.png	21	Remove ECTS (Pepper can't read it) Removed "The correct answer is three years for the Bachelor and two years for the Master. " as it is repeated anyways.										
How long has it been since the establishment of Cognitive Science at Osnabrueck University?	Approximately 17 years	More than 100 years	Barely 10 years	More than 60 years	The interdisciplinary Institute of Cognitive Science was established in June 2001 and officially inaugurated in November 2002. It was developed from the Institute for Semantic Information Analysis, which had existed since 1993.	ikw.png	20											
About how many students study Cognitive Science at Osnabrueck University?	Close to 380 Bachelor students, 150 Master students, and 50 PhDs 	Just under 170 Bachelor students	Over 900 Bachelor, Master, and PhD students	There is no cognitive science program at University Osnabrueck	This program is very popular as it was the first of its kind in Germany. It is taught in English with an international focus so it attracts students from all over the world. Each year the number of applications and students is rising.

Finish this logical argument: "All Spartans are warriors. All warriors are mortal. Therefore:"	All Spartans are mortal	All Spartans are men	All mortals are Spartan	All Spartans are immortal	The correct conclusion to this logical argument is that all Spartans are mortal, since being a warrior links together being Spartan and being mortal in this case. This argument can be broken down into, if A then B, and if B then C, to give us the conclusion if A then C.	Reasoning.png	15	What Quynh already mentioned in her Comment. The need to buy groceries does not follow from the possibility of beeing paid... Some other example might be better. Furthermore: Remove first sentence of Story as its getting repeated anyways when one choses the wrong answer
