Which of the following tasks will not be done by machines in the foreseeable future?	Creative tasks	Easy, monotonous tasks	Highly technical tasks	Machines will do all tasks, leaving humanity without work	We machines will ease the workload for humans in the future. When it comes down to easy, monotonous tasks or technical tasks, machines will be able to step in. But tasks involving for example creativity will stay the domain of humans in the foreseeable future.

In which way can you not benefit from artificial intelligence systems like Watson?	They can walk your dog	They can sharpen and expand your mental capabilities	They can amplify your knowledge and add to it	They can read much faster than humans	Many people think that we machines will take over the world one day. But I don't think that this will happen, as artificial intelligence is simply developed to help humans deepen their knowledge of the world. We machines can read much faster than humans, making it for example easier to extract information out of a text. With this, humans can develop new ideas faster than if they were to read all of the information by themselves.	readingrobot.png	0:05-0:12 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xcmh1LQB9I	23	The question might sound better if it is changed to "what is not a benefit that we can get from..." - or maybe something like "In which way can/do you humans not benefit from AI systems like watson? - changed it (Marcel)	Original: IBM Watson How it Works.mp4
Which of the following is not one of the three ethical conventions of IBM regarding responsible development of artificial intelligence?	Autonomy	Transparency	Skills	Support of humanity	It is very important to have ethical guidelines when it comes to artificial intelligence. IBM’s three ethical conventions are transparency, skills, and the support of humanity. It should be made transparent which data is used for what. AI systems should be developed by people who have the skills and experience to develop them. AI systems should support humans and not replace them.

What is the difference between Deep Learning and Machine Learning?	"Deep Learning” is a subfield of Machine Learning in which Artificial Neural Networks are created to automatically find patterns and connections in all kinds of data	There is no difference. The terms can be used interchangeably	"Deep Learning” describes systems that attempt to solve problems in a bottom-up manner. The system is given the fundamentals of a topic and subsequently draws it’s own conclusions. It’s a subfield of Machine Learning	The way humans learn is called "Deep Learning” and Machine Learning is the approach to replicate the underlying mechanisms with an algorithm	There are various different techniques and algorithms applied in Machine Learning like concept learning, decision trees, or reinforcement learning, just to name a few. One subfield of Machine Learning that has received special attention in recent years is "Deep Learning". Deep Learning has helped researchers to solve many problems like pattern recognition that were challenging for other Machine Learning approaches.	diff_DL_ML.png	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSbgixdC9g8			
How can you categorize the intelligence of an artificial system?	You distinguish between weak, strong, general, and super AI	There is something like an IQ test for AI called "Turing Test." The higher the score for the Turing Test, the smarter the system	Unfortunately, there is no way to do this yet	You distinguish between below-human, human-like and beyond-human intelligence	 Systems that are currently in use are considered to have weak AI. This means they are task-specific and have to be designed and trained by humans for a narrow domain. A "real" artificial intelligence in the literal sense, which is called strong AI or general AI in academics, does not exist yet. The same holds for a super AI. This describes a system completely superior to human intelligence. We do not assume that any system will exceed weak AI in the foreseeable future.	strong_weak_AI.png	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DDuZVJZW0AA8uSH.png	28		
Why it the term "Augmented Intelligence” sometimes used rather than "Artificial Intelligence”?	Because Augmented Intelligence implicates that the system enhances, scales, and accelerates human expertise. In contrast, AI is an umbrella term for all kind of learning computer systems 	Because it marks the beginning of merging "Artificial Intelligence” and "Augmented Reality”	Because AI marketing messed up the terminology	Trick Question! It’s actually called Cognitive Intelligence	There is actually no formal definition of Artificial Intelligence. The terms was first used in 1955 by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon. But they never explained what AI is suppose to comprise. Therefore the understanding of the term and the expectations of people vary a lot. With Augmented Intelligence one can describe systems that support humans and seem smart but are not actually awarded intelligence.

What are Artificial Neural Networks?	Computing systems which are inspired by how the human brain is build and aim to replicate the way humans learn	Computing systems which aim to map the topography and structure of a human brain with perfect accuracy	Neuronal "protheses” that replace human nerves, for example in stroke patients	A social network designed for people interested in artificial intelligence	Computers and brains work quite differently. Computers are fast in sequential processing but have tremendous problems when calculations are processed in parallel. With the brain, it is the other way around. Neurons are rather slow and need approximately 1 millisecond to activate but 10 billion neurons can work in parallel on the same process. The idea of artificial neural networks is to mimic this  neural capability for parallel procesing in software.   	ANN.mp4	1:43-2:04 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk		ADD STORY!

Which statement about Artificial Neural Networks is wrong?	ANNs can perform any task a human being can perform	The first paper about Artificial Neural Networks was published in the 1940s	Artificial Neural Networks need training data in order to learn to successfully achieve their task	Usually, artificial neurons in Artificial Neural Networks utilise binary signaling	Maybe surprisingly, the idea of Artificial Neural Networks has been around for a while now, but it’s taken the massive increase in computing power to finally become useful. And while Artificial Neural Networks are able to perform very well in small domains such as pattern recognition, we haven’t been able to integrate Artificial Neural Networks into a strong AI that can perform any task a human can perform.	intelligence-artificielle.png	1:43-2:04 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk	19	has the same video for question 8, 9, 10 - problematic? - Q I don't think so.-Laura	
What is not one of the main causes behind the "boom" of AI and Artificial Neural Networks?	The improvements in AI design such that robots are now either sleek or cute-looking	The up-to millionfold increase of computing capacity	Big data, i.e. the availability of big digital datasets about any and all topics	The improvement of AI algorithms	All three factors - big data, the improvement of AI algorithms, and the increase in computing power - influence each other. At the moment, this development doesn’t increase just linearly but exponentially! My developers are even now surprised by how adaptable and teachable we AI's are. So my tip is: expect the unexpected!	neurons.mp4	1:43-2:04 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk	20		
How many times do I need to look at your face on average until I can recognise you?	Between 2-5 times, but don’t go changing your hairstyle	5-8 times	Just once	I can’t recognise faces just yet	In principle, I can detect and learn to recognise your face. I just need some training, so you would have to show me your face up to 5 times. Also, I can only learn one person’s face at the same time. I’m still not perfect at it. Sometimes, it’s harder when I see you in a different location, or if you get a haircut or wear glasses. Basically, I'm just like a human who is not good with remembering faces!

What are AI technologies not presently capable of?	Creating music that fools even the most seasoned musician into thinking it is from a famous composer	Speech recognition	Object and pattern recognition	Having a conversation and booking an appointment for a client	AI technologies have come a long way in the last decade! You can see that in our natural language processing and understanding. A recent demonstration of that is the new Google Assistant. But while our abilities are getting pretty impressive, we’re still taking baby steps in computational music creation.

Complete this senstence: Watson is not...	A system which can cook your favorite pasta	A combination of dozens of AI-based technologies	A modular system with many different intelligent services	A system which once won Jeopardy	Watson is not a supercomputer, although it might appear as one. It is a modular system of many different intelligent services, like speech analysis, picture analysis, translations, or conversational assistance. Users can access these different services via cloud and integrate them into their organizational workflow.	IBMWatson.mp4	0:05-0:12 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xcmh1LQB9I			watson.png
Why does IBM believe that Artificial Intelligence is going to be an embedded part of machines and robots?	All answers are correct	Because the availability of data increased enormously	Because the impacts of Open Source and Open API-movements are becoming noticeable	Because AI as a cloud-service will become more affordable, while the quality of machine learning algorithms will improve rapidly	Several reasons for this conclusion exist: Firstly,they believe that AI cloud services will become much more affordable to purchase, while the quality of machine learning algorithms will improve rapidly. Secondly, the availability of data increased enormously. Lastly, the impacts of Open Source and Open API are becoming noticeable. This makes it much easier to combine them with intelligent services and applications.	IBMWatson.mp4	0:05-0:12 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xcmh1LQB9I	24		
What are the first fruits of IBM Watson?	Predictive Maintenance	The development of overthinking maintenance	Watson is overtaking the world	Watson is able to react autonomously to any human emotion with an appropriate emotion	An important operational area for IBM is Predictive Maintenance. AI based systems like Watson combine structured machine data with unstructured information such as handwritten recordings, speech, and videos, and then analyses and rates them. As a result, the development of a maintenance that is predictive instead of reactive is no longer a vision of the future.	maintenance.png		14		IBM_Watson_How_it_Works.mp4
Intelligent systems from IBM have been implemented in many projects of Cognitive Science students in Osnabrueck. Which of the following does not use IBM's services?  	Ethical/moral self-driving vehicles 	Flu prediction based on twitter data 	Pepper as a neuroscience tutor 	Intelligent crop rotation 	While moral decisions in self-driving vehicles are indeed investigated at our institute, we do not use IBM services for this project. Meanwhile, the other three projects use IBM Cloud services. The flu prediction uses the Watson Services, Pepper uses IBM Cloud services like Watson Discovery and Watson Conversation, and the crop rotation app required IBM's conversation tools for the chatbot as well as the Weather Company from IBM.	selfdriving.png		19		intelligence-artificielle.png
Where do the challenges of AI based technology lie?	The missing willingness to invest is an enormous barrier for the introduction, development, and implementation of AI systems	There are no technical challenges known	Many companies think that information technology has no future	More and more companies realize that the application of modern technology does not make a difference in bigger productivity or innovative capacity	Many companies suffer from investment accumulation regarding IT, because information technology has often been seen as a necessary evil and not as an opportunity. More and more companies realize that the application of modern technology can make a severe difference with regard to bigger productivity, innovative capacity and thereby more competitive ability.	oppurtunity.png	https://www.usine-digitale.fr/mediatheque/0/1/0/000283010/intelligence-artificielle.jpg	20		IBM_Watson_How_it_Works.mp4
Who is responsible for a self-learning robot which taught itself a certain function and then induces damages?	There is still industrial-comprehensive need for action regarding the question of liability for the misbehaviour of an intelligent robot or machine	The robot has a legal entity according to today’s law and can therefore autonomously take part in legal relations	The creator of the robot or AI is never responsible for any damages caused by the robot	Nobody is responsible for the damages caused by a self-learning (industrial) robot	Just as we robots are not able to effectively sign a contract, we are also not responsible for any caused damages. In the case of damage, the aggrieved party could assert a claim against several parties: the creator of the robot, the owner of the robot, the one responsible for the operation in this specific case, or even the party providing the information with which the robot learns.	lawyer.png	http://www.infolaw.co.uk/newsletter/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/robot1.png	23		
Who owns the data used by Watson?	The data is the intellectual property of the customer and will not be sold to anyone	The data is owned by IBM Watson. It can be sold to anyone	The data is owned by the US Government. They can scour the data for hints of criminal activity	The data is owned by the Illuminati and will be used for the purpose of world domination	Data protection is as important for Watson as it is for you and me. The data is completely owned by the users. They can completely decide what happens to the data. This is actually a major difference to other user-oriented AI's because they typically use all data provided by users. Of course, the data will also not be sold or transferred to third parties.	safety.png	0:05-0:12 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xcmh1LQB9I	20	changed AIs to Ai's	IBM_Watson_How_it_Works.mp4
There have been accusations that AI systems and the data they use are not transparent enough. How does Watson handle this?	It is completely up to the user what kind of data the system should use	The data is randomly pooled from the internet	The data is exclusively provided by Watson's "data experts”	The data is provided by the Illuminati for the purpose of world domination	Unlike most AI companies, it’s completely up to the user what kind of data the system can use. This means the data is completely transparent to the user. Hurray for data transparency!
