                                    We decided on out main goal for this semester: we want to develop an interactive game for Pepper. The game should be like the famous children game "I spy with my little eye" and Pepper should be able to play in the position of both the questioning and the answering player with a human opponent. To achieve our goal we divided the whole group into smaller groups with different focuses.
                                </p>
                                <h4> <u>
                                    Week 1 to 4
                                </u></h4>
                                <h5>Microphone Group</h5>
                                <p>
                                    We mostly did some research in the field of voice/speech recognition. We favoured using ICA (independent component analysis) over the idea of using an ANN because ICA seems to produce better and more stable results. Our goal is to recognize speech in a noisy environment and localize the speaker, so that during the game the player(s) can talk to pepper. To achieve this online and hopefully with multiple speakers we will also look into Kalman filters.
                                </p>
                                <h5>Object Recognition</h5>
                                <p>
                                    We started on our research into what algorithms/packages/etc. are available, to establish a broad overview into the field.
                                    We noticed during the research of different approaches and algorithms that probably a different set of objects would be best to use with each different algorithm.
                                </p>
                                <h5>Conversation and Natual Language Processing</h5>
                                <p>
                                    We set up a goal in terms of conversation and language processing. We searched for several existing chatbots and for how to apply them to our game. Moreover, we tried to outline upcoming works. We would use Python to build conversation structure and will see if API.AI and Watson Assistant are needed. The user throws a question "I spy with my little eye something[color name], starting the game. In addition to color, we plan to collect attributes that can be used for description of the object.
